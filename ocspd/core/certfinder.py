"""
This module locates certificate files in the supplied directories and parses
them. It then keeps track of the following:

- If cert is found for the first time (thus also when the daemon is started),
  the cert is added to the :attr:`ocspd.core.certfinder.CertFinder.scheduler`
  so the :class:`~ocspd.core.certparser.CertParserThread` can parse the
  certificate. The file modification time is recorded so file changes can be
  detected.

- If a cert is found a second time, the modification time is compared to the
  recorded modification time. If it differs, if it differs, the file is added
  to the scheduler for parsing again, any scheduled actions for the old file
  are cancelled.

- When certificates are deleted from the directories, the entries are removed
  from the cache in :attr:`ocspd.core.daemon.run.models`. Any scheduled actions
  for deleted files are cancelled.

The cache of parsed files is volatile so every time the process is killed
files need to be indexed again (thus files are considered "new").
