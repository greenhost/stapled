stapled (1.2) stretch; urgency=low

 * Updated dependencies with vulnerabilities, not afftecting stapled.
 * Added the --one-off argument that allows running stapled in one-off mode
   which is a mode that runs staple fetching for all certificates as usual,
   including threading, but stops threads once they are finished with their
   queues and then quits.
 * Reduced minimum time to live setting for keeping HAProxy sockets open to 10
   seconds.
 * Reduced default time to live setting for keeping HAProxy sockets open to 10
   seconds. This should still be more then enough for all expected conditions
   stapled could run under.

stapled (1.1) stretch; urgency=low

stapled (0.8) stretch; urgency=low

 * FIX: Don't delete staple files for invalid certificates, instead zero the
        file so HAProxy will still serve staples once the certificates are
        valid again.
 * Improved documentation and applied stricter coding style standards.

stapled (0.7) stretch; urgency=low

stapled (0.6) stretch; urgency=low

 * Improvement: Remove some spaces from log lines.

stapled (0.5) stretch; urgency=low

 * Improved consistency in source code.
 * Improved exception handling.
 * Add an argument that tells stapled to parse a HAProxy config file for
   sockets and certificate directories.
 * It is now possible to specify single certificate aside from entire
   directories.
 * DEPRECATED: --directories was superseded by --cert-paths.

stapled (0.4) stretch; urgency=low

 * Improve the stability of the socket communication.
 * Add a time stamp to the log output.
 * Reduce the noise for log level INFO.
 * Fix an edge case where HAProxy is not aware of staples that are still valid
   and where stapled decides fetching new ones is not necessary.
 * Fix recursive mode when used with HAProxy sockets, there is no practial
   use case for this and it is still not supported but it won't cause an
   exception anymore and manual testing can be done in recursive mode now.
 * Fix various typo's in documentation.
 * Improve documentation of the config file.
 * Add note about HAProxy's stapling perculiarities in README and
   documentation.
